First_Ray_Tracer
================

Working on developing my first ray tracer.

I am following the book - "Ray Tracing from the Ground Up, by Kevin Suffern.

I am using the bare-bone ray tracer he provides to start my project.
Which is found in the book's website http://www.raytracegroundup.com/

My goal is to follow this book to have a better understanding how images are
rendered through the graphical pipeline and to render a photo-realistic image.
